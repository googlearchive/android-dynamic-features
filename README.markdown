## Introduction

The sample contains several modules.

`app` -> Contains the base application which always will be installed on device.

The `MainActivity` class demonstrates how to use the API to load and launch features.

The `BaseSplitActivity` abstract class implements the required `SplitCompat.Install()` call
in the `attachBaseContext` method. This allow to launch an activity from a freshly downloaded
dynamic module without having the restart the application.

`features/*` -> Contains features which can be downloaded on demand using the PlayCore API.
`instant/*` -> Contains instant enabled features which can be downloaded using the PlayCore API or via Url.

Each feature as some distinctly unique characteristics.

`features/assets` -> Feature containing only assets.
`features/kotlin` -> Feature written in Kotlin.
`features/java` -> Feature written in Java.
`features/native` -> Feature written in Kotlin using JNI.
`instant/split` -> Instant Feature without an URL route. Loaded using Split
Install API
`instant/url` -> Instant Feature with a URL route

The `AndroidManifest` files in each feature show
how to declare a feature module as part of a dynamic app. Any module with the
instant attribute is instant enabled. In this sample these can be found in the
`instant/` folder:

```
  <dist:module
    dist:instant="true"/>
```
